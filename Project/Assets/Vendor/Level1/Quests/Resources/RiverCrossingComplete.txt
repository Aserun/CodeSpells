1=The watch-gnome is on the roof of this building and he told me he needs some expert wizard help, I think you can help him.
2=First, you need to get on my special crate and leviate up to the watch-gnome. He'll explain the rest. 
3=Jump on top of the crate, look down, and cast the LEVITATE spell on it. That will make you levitate with the crate.
4=Do you want to help the watch-gnome now?
