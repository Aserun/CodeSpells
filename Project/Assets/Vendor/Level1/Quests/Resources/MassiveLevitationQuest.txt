0=Hi! I'm trying to make some of these rocks levitate, but it's taking too long to levitate each one individually.
1=Can you help me craft a spell that will levitate all the objects in an area?
2=Awesome! First, you'll need a staff. Do you have one?
3=Try flying around to collect the bread. If you talk to the gnomes with blue arrows in front of and on top of the house, they'll help you!
4=Did you get your staff?
5=Great! Now try creating an area over by the rocks. Just drag the staff into the game and drop it. Then talk to me again.
6=Did you get an area made?
7=Try to create an area. If you need help, just ask Sam!
8=Yippee! You should have a spell in your Spellbook that puts everything in an area on fire.
9=Did you find the spell? It's called MassiveFire.
10=Perfect. Try changing the spell so that it levitates everything in the area instead of putting it on fire.
11=When you think you're done, press the lock in the Badge Book and Sam will come give you a badge!
12=Did Sam unlock your Massive Levitate badge?
13=That's great! Now that you've made everything in the area levitate, try changing the spell to put everything back on the ground.
14=Don't forget to ask Sam to unlock the badge for you!
15=Did Sam unlock your Massive Unlevitate badge?
16=Wow! You're doing so well. Maybe now you could change your spell to make everything in the area do a creative dance?
17=When you finish, get Sam to unlock your badge!
