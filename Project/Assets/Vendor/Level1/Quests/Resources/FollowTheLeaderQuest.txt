0=Hi! My friend taught me how to summon my crate to me, but now I want to make it follow me wherever I go.
1=Did you learn how to summon an object from my friend with the yellow arrow?
2=Try talking to my friend with the yellow arrow to learn how to summon an object first.
3=Awesome! Try changing your summoning spell so that the object will follow you around forever.
4=I would try looking at your Sentry spell for some ideas. I think it runs forever. The spellbook might give you some clues.
5=If you need help, just ask Sam!
6=When you think you're done, press the lock in the Badge Book and Sam will come give you a badge!
7=That's all I have to teach you. Ask Sam if you need help!
