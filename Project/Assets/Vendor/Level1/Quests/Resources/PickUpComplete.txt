2=I would try using a spell from your spellbook. Maybe you can teleport to that big boudler across the river.
3=Did you figure out how to get across the river?
4=I would use a TELEPORTATION spell if I were you. You can copy it out of your spellbook and then cast it on the big boulder that's across the river!
5=Can you deliver my presents to my friend now?
