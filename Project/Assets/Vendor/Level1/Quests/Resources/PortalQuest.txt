0=Hi there! We never get very many visitors over here in our village. I think it's because the river monster eats them all when they try to cross the river.
1=I want to open a portal across the river so that anyone who walks into it will automatically be transported across the river. Could you help me?
2=Well, first you'll need your staff. Do you have it?
3=Try flying around to collect the bread. If you talk to the gnomes with blue arrows in front of and on top of the house, they'll help you!
4=Did you get your staff?
5=Great! Now try creating two areas. To create an area, just drag the staff into the game and drop it. Then talk to me again.
6=Did you get two areas made?
7=Try to create two areas. If you need help, just ask Sam!
8=Now try to write a portal spell that will take everything in one area and put it in the other area. Don't forget to make it do this forever!
9=Hmm... You might get some ideas from Teleport, MassiveFire, Architecture, or Sentry.
10=If you need help, just ask Sam!
11=When you think you're done, press the lock in the Badge Book and Sam will come give you a badge!
12=That's all I have to teach you. If you need help, just ask Sam!
