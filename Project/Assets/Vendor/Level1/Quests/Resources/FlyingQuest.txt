0=I hear you are willing to help me?
1=Since I'm all the way up here, the baker gnomes can't get bread to me. I tried summoning bread to me, but it only worked half-way!
2=All of the bread I was trying to summon is stuck floating around. If you could fly around on your crate, when you run into the bread you will give it the magic it needs to complete the summon to me!
3=Great! Thank you so much!
4=I would use your FLYING spell, if you cast it on your crate (by looking down first) you will be able to fly using left, right, look up and look down.
5=Can you collect my bread now?
