0=Oh No! I wanted a fire pit like my cousins, but it has gotten out of control! I don't know how to put it out and I think only water can put it out! Can you put water on this huge fire?
1=I think the easiest thing would be to bring the huge rain cloud over my fire.
2=Great! Thank you for trying to help :)
3=I would SUMMON the cloud over to you, as long as you are standing near the fire the rain will hit the fire and put it out!
4=Did you find the SUMMONING spell?
