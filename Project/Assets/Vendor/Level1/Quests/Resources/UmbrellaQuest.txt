0=I'm getting sick and tired of listening to my little brother, Alex, complain about getting wet in the rain! Can you help me make an umbrella for him?
1=Maybe you can write a spell that will make an object teleport itself over his head wherever he goes.
2=Hmm... The spell will probably be similar to Teleport and Follow The Leader. Have you gotten the Follow The Leader Badge?
3=You might want to try Follow The Leader. Talk to my friend with the purple arrow over by the water fountain.
4=Great! Maybe you can cast your Umbrella spell on this crate or something and have it hover over Alex's head wherever he goes.
5=To see if your Umbrella spell will follow Alex, try casting one of your Dance spells on him.
6=That's all I have to teach you. Thanks for trying to save me from my brother's whining!
