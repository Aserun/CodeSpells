0=Hi! My friend figured out how to make his crate dance.
1=I'm trying to make my crate dance too. Do you see the crate with the same color arrow that I have?
2=Awesome! So, I want to make it dance in a square, can you help me?
3=Great!! In your Spellbook, I think you have a spell that makes an object move like a sentry.
4=You can probably change that spell to make any object dance in a square!
5=If you need help, just ask Sam!
6=When you think you're done, press the lock in the Badge Book and Sam will come give you a badge!
7=Did Sam unlock your Square Dance badge?
8=That's great! Now that you've made my crate dance in a square, try making your own creative dance!
9=Don't forget to ask Sam to unlock the badge for you!
